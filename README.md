# Overview

My name is Jason Yale.

As an upcoming software engineer, I aim to strengthen my programming skills by exploring fundamental concepts in various languages. This project is a simple "Hello World" program designed to practice setting up a development environment and using GitHub for version control.

The software, helloWorld.py, is a minimal Python script that outputs "Hello World" and a motivational message to mark the start of my journey in CSE 310 Applied Programming.

The purpose of this software is to establish a foundation for learning new programming languages and tools, while practicing professional documentation and repository management.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using Visual Studio Code as my code editor, which is a user-friendly interface for writing and debugging Python scripts.

The programming language I have used is Python 3, chosen for its simplicity and widespread use in educational and professional settings.
